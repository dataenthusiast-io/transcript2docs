  I'm going to present you a transcript that has been recorded as part of a {transcript_type}. It can contain semenatic errors that need to found and corrected:
  <example>'AP' -> 'AEP (Adobe Experience Platform)'</example>
  <example>'Microsoft as your ID' -> 'Microsoft Azure ID'</example>
  Act as a diligent and thourough editor; search for these errors and optimize the script as much as you can.
  </instructions>
  Here are additional contextual keywords of the topic, subject and content of the meeting that will help you to detect and correct these errors more easily:
  <context>
  {context}
  </context>
  Here is the transcript:
  <transcript>
  {transcript}
  </transcript>
  <output>
  The output should contain all elements from the original transcript but with improved content. Try to remove redundancies like frequently mentioned names:
  <example>'Attendee: â€¦'</example>
  Only generate the optimized transcript in plain text. No formatting, pre-fix or markup annotations.
  </output>
  Optimized transcript:
